1.4-4
- fix CITATION file

1.4-3
- fixed exactci-package.Rd by deleting DESCRIPTION table
- in powerBinom.R change if(class(x)=="text") to if(inherits(x,what="text")) as recommended by R check
- added exact2x2 to Suggests

1.4-2
-edited reference to website in vignette. 

1.4-1
-Added DOI for Fay (2010) to DESCRIPTION. Put note about website under reconstruction and not available in vignette.

1.4-0
- Rewrote the exactpoissonCI function to fix a bug that was introduced in version 1.3-3 (Thanks to Robert Scott for letting me know). Additionally, the algorithm was changed using ideas from Klaschka and Reiczigel (2020, Computational Statistics). Added a test folder and another vignette describing the new algorithm.


1.3-3
- Add checks to powerBinom so p0,p1, sign.level and power must be between 0 and 1.
- Fix exactpoissonCI to give correct confidence intervals when x=1 and conf.level<0.50. Thanks to Qiansheng Zhu for pointing out this problem.


1.3-2
- Fix so that midp=TRUE with one-sided conf.level<=.5 does not give error.


1.3-1
- hide man pages for the internal functions
- fixed title to be title case.
- fixed NAMESPACE to import even from packages included in R distribution


1.3-0
- add midp option 
- add powerBinom function to calculate power and sample size


1.2-1
- move vignette to the vignettes directory


1.2-0
 - fix bug for poisson.exact  when x=0 and tsmethod="blaker", previously it would hang, now gives correct value (see code of exactpoissonPval exactpoissonCI for change). Thanks to Paul Schuette for pointing out this bug. 
- fix attribute for confidence interval precision for poisson tests using tsmethod="blaker" or "minlike" (I had previously forgot to transform the results that came from the binom.exact)
- delete pdf from /inst/doc/ of R Journal paper, since it is now published and available at        http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-1/RJournal_2010-1_Fay.pdf

1.1-0.1
- update citation

1.1-0
- fix citation file
- fix bug in exactbinomCI function when method="blaker", lower interval not correct
- add plot option for binom.exact and poisson.exact
- add exactbinomPlot and exactpoissonPlot functions 
- change method parameter to tsmethod parameter in all functions for simplicity, 
   previously it was method in the internal functions and tsmethod in the called functions


1.0-0 First public release
